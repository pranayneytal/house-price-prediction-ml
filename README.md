# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

Regression-based machine learning project to predict house prices using numerical features.

---

## 🧠 Problem Type
Regression

---

## 📊 Dataset
California Housing Dataset (scikit-learn)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 🛠️ Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Random Forest performed significantly better, capturing non-linear relationships.

---

## Results

- Two regression models were evaluated: Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Performance was measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, achieving lower MAE and RMSE values.
- The improvement highlights the effectiveness of non-linear, ensemble-based models for real-world regression tasks.
- Actual vs predicted price plots were used to visually assess model performance.
